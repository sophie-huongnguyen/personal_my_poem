Nocturne

Thomas Bailey Aldrich
Flower and Thorn
1877

Up to her chamber window
A slight wire trellis goes,
And up this Romeo's ladder
Clambers a bold white rose.

I lounge in the ilex shadows,
I see the lady lean,
Unclasping her silken girdle,
The curtain's folds between.

She smiles on her white-rose lover,
She reaches out her hand
And helps him in at the window--
I see it where I stand!

To her scarlet lip she holds him,
And kisses him many a time--
Ah, me! it was he that won her
Because he dared to climb!
