Who loves the trees best?
"I," said the spring,
"Their leaves so beautiful
To them I bring."

Who loves the trees best?
"I,"" summer said,
"I give them blossoms,
White, yellow, red."

Who loves the trees best?
I," said the fall,
"I give luscious fruits,
Bright tints to all!"

Who loves the trees best?
"I love them best,"
Harsh winter answered,
"I give them rest."
